# Deep-learning-HW3


## Introduction
In this repository, three GANs, i.e., DCGAN, WGAN, and ACGAN, are built to generate the realistic images based on cifar-10 dataset. In each subfolder, there are also ten example images generated by the GANs. 

## How to train the network (e.g., DCGAN)
python DCGAN.py


## How to evaluate the trained model (e.g., DCGAN)
There is a jupyternotebook within each folder can be used to restore the models, generate the images, and track the training plots. 


## How to get the FID score
The repository <https://github.com/bioinf-jku/TTUR> can be used. 


## The packages
python==3.6
tensorflow==1.14
numpy
